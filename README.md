##note

Please excuse the semi-gross formatting as this app is being built while learning
Android development and during a hackathon ([RIT BrickHack](https://brickhack.io/)).
The codebase will be recieving refactoring and style-cleanup once the functionality is in place.

This application is being first developed using the pre SDK v22 Camera API because my
primary device has yet to be updated to 5.0 (Droid MAXX).
