##Generating a Data Set for Crunching

This process will be getting much easier over the next few days.

To generate a data set do the following:

1. Get a meter stick or tape measure & something to focus on

2. Open the app

3. Starting @ 5cm from your phone focus on the object and press record data point.

4. Move your phone back 3cm and repeat until you reach 80cm.

5. Close the app and open `Android/data/com.sizeof.sizeof/files/data.txt`

6. Move the text file to you computer and run it through the [number cruncher](/getSizeOf/sizeOf-NumberCrunching).

the rest of the steps for modifying key functions using the output equation will be posted soon.

##note

Please excuse the semi-gross formatting as this app is being built while learning
Android development and during a hackathon ([RIT BrickHack](https://brickhack.io/)).
The codebase will be recieving refactoring and style-cleanup once the functionality is in place.

This application is being first developed using the pre SDK v22 Camera API because my
primary device has yet to be updated to 5.0 (Droid MAXX).
